# Project Name

This is a little app where a voice will tell you a joke from a joke API

## Thoughts

I have created text to speech projects in the past. This one was different in that it used a joke API to speak the joke. This was a pretty interesting project. It's a neat little app that can be fun for a few minutes listening to your computer tell you some jokes.

## My Cusomizations

Something I added myself was three options on the page to let the user choose the kinds of jokes they want. This can give the user a little more customizations on what they want to listen to.

## Running this Locally

1. Go to the documentation page for the Voice RSS Text to Speech API page found [here](https://www.voicerss.org/)
2. Click on 'API Key' and then 'Get Api Key'.
3. Create a free account.
4. When your account is created, you need to activate the account by clicking the 'Activate Account' button on the sign up page or by email.
5. Once your account is activated, you can copy your API key and paste it into the script.js file.
   - Line 6, insert in 'APY_KEY' your API key contained in single quotes.
